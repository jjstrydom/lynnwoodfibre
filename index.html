								<h2>Frogfoot selected as fibre internet service provider</h2>
								<p>After the submissions have been received through the RFP process we
									appointed Frogfoot to provide fibre services for the Lynnwood Fibre Initiative
									(now covering a large part of Pretoria East).
									The RFP process had submissions from Dark Fibre Africa,
									Fibrehoods, Frogfoot, Link Africa, Telkom Wholesale (Openserve),
									Vodacom and Vumatel. The competition was tough, however after our
									evaluation process through a scored weighted matrix Frogfoot was the
									clear winner with a score of 93%. Second place received a score of 86%
									while third place scored 67%.
									All the supporting documentation, submitted proposals, calculation
									tables, memorandum of understanding etc. can be found

								<h2>OPEN NETWORK</h2>
								<p>Open network means more choice, more control, less cost, and no duplication. Any ISP can deliver service on the network, and we benefit from their competition. You can easily choose between speed, data, and ISPs at an instant's notice. Once the fibre is installed, there is no need to ever lay a network again. Fibre is future proof, and an open network guarantees access to any service provider.</p>

								<h2>PROPERTY VALUE</h2>
								<p>The latest research shows that fibre to the home can increase the value of your home by up to 8%. Homes in areas with high quality fibre are in greater demand, and these homes are in short supply. The average house in Lynnwood is valued at more than R 3 Million. Even a just a 1% increase in property value would pay for a 100 Mbps fibre line with a 200 GB data cap for more than TWO AND A HALF YEARS!</p>

								<h2>COMMUNITY and HOME SECURITY</h2>
								<p>A Fibre network in the Lynnwood community allows for increased security. The Fibre network could connect CCTV cameras within our community. These cameras could focus on the entrances and exits of the community, as well as other high risk areas (such as parks and open areas of land). Your home security camera could be monitored from anywhere in the world, to make sure everything is still in order while you are away.</p>

								<h2>AMAZINGLY FAST</h2>
								<p>Fibre Speeds in South Africa can reach up to 1 Gbps. It is 25x faster than the fastest VADSL speed, and 250x faster than the average ADSL speed. Even better, you achieve full speeds over your line during all 24 hours of the day. Don't consider yourself a speed freak? Don't worry, there is an option for everyone.</p>
